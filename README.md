# Curved Offset Bearing Housing / Pedestal Mount — SolidWorks CAD Model

## Overview
This SolidWorks project models a robust **offset curved bearing support bracket** (also referred to as a curved pedestal, angled bearing housing, or heavy-duty offset mount).  
The component features:
- A large cylindrical boss/housing (Ø125 mm outer, thick wall)
- A strongly curved/radiused transition section
- A reinforced base flange with slotted mounting holes
- Multiple large fillet radii for stress distribution
- Thick material sections suitable for cast iron, steel, or heavy-duty aluminum

Designed for applications requiring high load capacity, vibration resistance, and offset shaft/bearing mounting.

## Objective
Accurately recreate the geometry from the provided technical drawing using SolidWorks sketching, extrude, revolve, sweep, fillet, and hole/wizard tools — while maintaining all critical dimensions and manufacturing-friendly features.

## Design Specifications
All dimensions in **millimeters (mm)**

## SolidWorks Tools & Features Demonstrated
- 2D Sketching → Line, Arc (3-point, tangent), Circle, Slot
- Sketch Relations → Tangent, Coincident, Symmetric, Horizontal/Vertical
- Features → Extrude Boss/Base, Extrude Cut, Revolve, Sweep (with guide curves if needed)
- Fillet → Variable radius (R5, R12, R18, R42)
- Hole Wizard → For potential bearing mounting (not shown in drawing)
- Mirror / Symmetry
- Shell (if internal wall thickness is modeled)
- Chamfer (small edge breaks)
- Appearance / Material assignment (cast iron / steel look)

## Design Features
- Thick base flange with multiple mounting slots for flexible installation
- Large Ø125 mm cylindrical boss suitable for bearing housing or shaft support
- Generously radiused curved transition → excellent stress flow & fatigue resistance
- Reinforced ribbing along the curve for torsional & bending stiffness
- No sharp corners → suitable for casting, forging, or heavy machining
- Symmetrical about the vertical centerline

## Manufacturing Considerations
Recommended processes:
- Sand casting (gray iron, ductile iron) + machining
- Steel fabrication (flame/plasma cut base + rolled/welded tube + machining)
- CNC milling from solid billet (steel or aluminum)
- Investment casting for smaller series (stainless)

Typical materials:
- EN-GJL-250 (gray cast iron)
- EN-GJS-400-15 (ductile iron)
- S355J2 / AISI 1045 steel
- 7075-T6 aluminum (lighter applications)

## Typical Applications
- Conveyor roller / idler supports
- Agricultural machinery pivot mounts
- Industrial fan / blower housings
- Heavy equipment linkage supports
- Machine tool structural elements
- Crane / hoist bearing pedestals
